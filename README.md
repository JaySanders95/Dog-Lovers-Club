# Dog Lovers Club

The Dog Lovers' club is a community and a service for dog owners, it offers one off services such as simple walks or subscription services for 5 days a week walks, grooming and feeding of the dogs.

Users of this site would be able to see a brief overview of what the mission statement is for the website, this includes services that are offered, where to find the centre and a message from one of the community members of the week.

AM I . RESPONSIVE Will go in here once the site is fully finished

## NAVIGATION
- the navigation bar is shown at the top of the page once it renders and will follow the user down the screen, remaining at the top of the screen for ease of access to all the available sections of the page.
- the links are for Home, which takes the user to the very top of the page. This can also be accessed by clicking on the "Dog Lovers' club" text at the top of the page. The other links are 'About' which will take the user to the about section, 'services' to show what services the site has to offer and 'community' which is the member of the week section with a small bio of text. they are clearly labelled and centered for ease of use.
-The font used in the navigation bar is 'Overpass' and matches that of the rest of the website, the only other font used in this website page was 'Exo 2' which was used for the logo. The main used color for all fonts was 'whitesmoke' which contrasts nicely with the background, which is a type of smoke grey. 


## Header
- the header was mainly the navigation bar with the logo cleanly above the navigation buttons.
- the main focus of this was to clean and as efficient as possible, only putting vital information in front of the user without overloading them with information.
- the main focal point of the website is an image in the centre of the screen above the 'about us' section.

## About us
- within this section was split into 3 parts; "who we are" which explains what the community is and what basic services we offer.  'clean' which informs the user that we offer more services than just walking dogs & 'longer than a day' which  informs the user that we offer services such as dog-sitting.

## Services
- This section shows 3 individual squares across the page, one for the most basic service "just a walk", one for the "monthly service" which in a short paragraph informs the user for a monthly fee they will get 5 walks a week and we offer a grooming service included. The last section is "emergency services" and the user is not shown a price, this would be a difference in price depending on the length of dog-sitting. all three sections have a 'let's go' button, which if was coded would take the user to a payment screen/login screen if not logged in/booking screen.
- The text for the services matches the same colour scheme for the rest of the text (whitesmoke) and is also displayed on the same background colour for the logo and nav bar, keeping a consistent colour for the website.
