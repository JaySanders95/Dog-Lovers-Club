                My name is Casey and i joined Dog Lovers' club in 2019; I have alot of spare time since my children grew up and I adore dogs!
                My favourite breed of dog is the Shibu Inu as they are as adorable as they are intelligent. I went from an avid user of 
                the dog walking service to joining the team, i just love our little furry friends!
